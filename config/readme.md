To set up the database environment:

1) The easy way, just do it once: run main.py and follow the prompts.  This is going to be machine specific, so make sure you're putting in the stuff for the machine that the code is going to run on
  a) if you are putting the info for a database instance that is not on the machine you are currently working on, you will see an error message, and no experiments will go on for now.
  
  
2) The Hard Way: 

take this and fill in the "HERE" with the correct values: 
{"database name": "HERE", "host": "HERE", "password": "HERE", "user": "HERE"}

Then save it to database_setup.json in this folder

Cheers!
